At yesterday’s Council meeting, the Canal Days Advisory Committee presented a report with recommendations for postponing the much-loved annual event which was scheduled to take place July 30 to Aug. 2, 2021. This decision, although difficult to make, was based on current provincial legislation and public health guidelines. “With less than three months until the scheduled event, we had to realistically look at festival operations,” said Mayor Bill Steele. “Although COVID case numbers are decreasing as more people are getting vaccinated, for the safety of this community we couldn’t justify hosting an event that we know draws significant crowds. We’re confident that although postponing Canal Days yet again, next year we can safely welcome visitors to our community from all over the world to take full advantage of the festival, experience our vibrant local businesses, delicious restaurants, sandy beaches and beautiful outdoor spaces.” The Canal Days Advisory Committee consulted with external key partners and senior management before making the recommendation to Council. The committee reviewed alternative options, such as hosting a virtual Canal Days event, however felt it wouldn’t encompass the essence of what Canal Days is; an opportunity to bring people together to celebrate local marine heritage, participate in weekend activities and experience the community’s history, culture and music scene. Instead, the recommendation was put forward to postpone the event and plan for an incredible 2022 festival that residents and visitors can enjoy in person. “We want the community to know this wasn’t an easy decision,” said Scott Luey, CAO. “With so many moving pieces to this pandemic, it just wasn’t feasible for us to execute it this year. However, I do want to extend my gratitude to the community for their support over the past year. Thank you for your patience, understanding and commitment to safety as we continue to navigate COVID-19” The Canal Days Marine Heritage Festival has a significant economic impact on the community, with more than 300,000 attendees each year, and many local businesses participating, including restaurants, bars, and retailers across the city. City staff and the Canal Days Advisory Committee will continue to monitor provincial legislation and, if possible, focus on creating and executing smaller-scale community-oriented events in the Fall of 2021. “To say we’re disappointed would be an understatement,” said Stephanie Baswick, Director Port Colborne Historical &amp; Marine Museum. “Each year we look forward to welcoming thousands of people to our vibrant community to showcase our beloved marine heritage. However, given the current climate we know postponing the event for another year is the right decision. Although we can’t celebrate in person, Museum staff are currently working on some fun, historical, and maybe even a little musical, virtual events to highlight our marine heritage. More information will be available on the Museum’s social channels and website in the coming months.” The festival everyone knows, and loves will be back, July 29 to Aug. 1, 2022 and Council Members and City staff look forward to PORTicipating with everyone safely.

At yesterday’s Council meeting, the Canal Days Advisory Committee presented a report with recommendations for postponing the much-loved annual event which was scheduled to take place July 30 to Aug. 2, 2021. This decision, although difficult to make, was based on current provincial legislation and public health guidelines. “With less than three months until the scheduled event, we had to realistically look at festival operations,” said Mayor Bill Steele. “Although COVID case numbers are decreasing as more people are getting vaccinated, for the safety of this community we couldn’t justify hosting an event that we know draws significant crowds. We’re confident that although postponing Canal Days yet again, next year we can safely welcome visitors to our community from all over the world to take full advantage of the festival, experience our vibrant local businesses, delicious restaurants, sandy beaches and beautiful outdoor spaces.” The Canal Days Advisory Committee consulted with external key partners and senior management before making the recommendation to Council. The committee reviewed alternative options, such as hosting a virtual Canal Days event, however felt it wouldn’t encompass the essence of what Canal Days is; an opportunity to bring people together to celebrate local marine heritage, participate in weekend activities and experience the community’s history, culture and music scene. Instead, the recommendation was put forward to postpone the event and plan for an incredible 2022 festival that residents and visitors can enjoy in person. “We want the community to know this wasn’t an easy decision,” said Scott Luey, CAO. “With so many moving pieces to this pandemic, it just wasn’t feasible for us to execute it this year. However, I do want to extend my gratitude to the community for their support over the past year. Thank you for your patience, understanding and commitment to safety as we continue to navigate COVID-19” The Canal Days Marine Heritage Festival has a significant economic impact on the community, with more than 300,000 attendees each year, and many local businesses participating, including restaurants, bars, and retailers across the city. City staff and the Canal Days Advisory Committee will continue to monitor provincial legislation and, if possible, focus on creating and executing smaller-scale community-oriented events in the Fall of 2021. “To say we’re disappointed would be an understatement,” said Stephanie Baswick, Director Port Colborne Historical & Marine Museum. “Each year we look forward to welcoming thousands of people to our vibrant community to showcase our beloved marine heritage. However, given the current climate we know postponing the event for another year is the right decision. Although we can’t celebrate in person, Museum staff are currently working on some fun, historical, and maybe even a little musical, virtual events to highlight our marine heritage. More information will be available on the Museum’s social channels and website in the coming months.” The festival everyone knows, and loves will be back, July 29 to Aug. 1, 2022 and Council Members and City staff look forward to PORTicipating with everyone safely.
